#  Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning

##  Overview
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in textual data (like tweets or comments) using machine learning techniques. It aims to build an automated system that identifies whether a given text contains hate speech, offensive language, or is neutral.

---

##  Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that can classify text into categories such as:
- Hate Speech
- Offensive Language
- Neutral / Clean Text

---

##  Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Datasets used:
  - Kaggle Datasets
  - Tweets via Twitter API (optional)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove:
  - Punctuation
  - URLs
  - Mentions (@username)
  - Numbers
  - Stopwords
- Apply:
  - Tokenization
  - Lemmatization or Stemming
- Vectorization using:
  - TF-IDF
  - Bag-of-Words (BoW)
  - Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

### 3. Model Training
Machine learning models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Deep Learning (LSTM or BERT â€“ optional)

### 4. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

### 5. Deployment (Optional)
- Web App: Streamlit / Flask
- REST API: FastAPI
- Containerization: Docker

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- NLTK / SpaCy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Flask / Streamlit
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Ethical Considerations
- Avoid using biased or harmful datasets
- Ensure fairness and transparency
- Maintain user privacy
- Include human-in-the-loop moderation

---

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automating hate speech detection. With proper preprocessing and modeling, we can build robust systems that contribute to safer online communities.
